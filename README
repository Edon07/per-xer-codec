How to build (All directories are relative to repository root):

1) Add the necessary ASN 1 files to the directory asn1-codegen/src/asn1/ (You will need to create this directory, as git does not commit empty directories)

2) run 'make' inside of the asn1-codegen directory, and follow up with 'make install'
    This will:
        a) Builld the asn1c compiler
        b) Install it into asn1-codegen/install/src
        c) Generate the c code using the ASN.1 files provided
        d) Move them to the jni/asn1 directory

3a) In eclipse, select the correct toolchain under Project->Properties->C/C++ Build->Toolchain Editor->Current Toolchain
    Pick "Linux GCC" for linux
    Pick "MacOSC GCC" for mac
3b) Select the correct output extension under Project->Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Build Artifact
    Pick "so" for linux
    Pick "dylib" for mac
3c) Build the generated c code using the eclipse-generated makefile
    This will:
        Generate the file asn1-jni-test/libperxercodec.dylib/so, depending on the toolchain selected in eclipse
    
4) Run the maven "package" goal
    This will:
        Copy the dynamic libraries generated in step 4 to the correct places
        Build the classes and dynamic libraries into the file target/asn1-jni-test-*.jar
        
The jar is now ready to use

How to Deploy:

Place the jar file generated by the build process
